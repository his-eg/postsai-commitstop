# Commit Stop
**Manage Push Permissions**

*Commit Stop* allows the management of push permissions for source code repositories. 

For example only certain people may be allowed to commit directly to Git master. Or
commits to a certain release branch are only allowed with special information in the 
commit message.

Please see [https://hiseg.github.io/commitstop](https://hiseg.github.com/commitstop) for details.
